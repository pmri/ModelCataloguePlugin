                    <description>Record the time when the symptoms were first noted related to this diagnosis as agreed between the consultant and the patient.   Depending on the length of time this should normally include at least month and year. Day should also be included if known. If symptoms have been present for a long time then it may only be possible to record the year. This will normally be recorded by the consultant first seeing the patient in secondary care.

                        <description>Record the overall TNM stage grouping of the tumour, derived from each T, N and M component after  treatment. This classification is based on all the evidence available to the clinician(s) with responsibility for assessing the patient. Such evidence arises from physical examination, imaging, endoscopy, biopsy, surgical exploration and other relevant examinations.

                            The overall integrated TNM stage grouping indicates the tumour stage after treatment and/or after all available evidence has been collected.

                            Note: Use UICC coding.</description>

                            <description>The OPCS Classification of Interventions and Procedures (OPCS-4) is a Fundamental Information Standard.  The classification is used by Health Care Providers and national and regional ORGANISATIONS.

                                http://www.datadictionary.nhs.uk/web_site_content/supporting_information/clinical_coding/opcs_classification_of_interventions_and_procedures.asp?shownav=1

                                OPCS-4 is used to support operational and strategic planning, resource utilisation, performance management, reimbursement, research and epidemiology.  It is used by NHS suppliers to build/update software to support NHS business functions and interoperability.</description>

                        Stage 1  - disease is limited to a single tumour or to one lymph node group (e.g., neck, axilla, groin, etc.) outside of the abdomen or mediastinum.

                        Stage 2 - disease is limited to one tumour with local lymph node involvement; or to two or more tumours or lymph node groups on the same side of the diaphragm; or to a completely resected primary tumour of the gastrointestinal tract with/without involvement of local lymph nodes.

                        Stage 3 - disease includes tumours or lymph node groups involved on both sides of the diaphragm; or any primary intrathoracic tumour (mediastinal, pleural or thymic disease); or extensive NHL within the abdomen; or any paraspinal or epidural tumours.

                        Stage 4 - disease involves the bone marrow and / or central nervous system (CNS), with/without other sites of involvement. Bone marrow involvement in NHL is defined as &gt;5% - &lt;25% malignant cells in an otherwise normal bone marrow. (&gt; 25% malignant cells in the bone marrow is defined as leukaemia).</description>

                        Stage 2 -  tumour is completely resected, and there is no evidence of tumour at or beyond the margins of resection but the tumour extends beyond the kidney (penetration of capsule, invasion of blood vessels outside renal parenchyma).

                            <description>The international prototype of the kilogram, an artefact made of platinum-iridium, is kept at the BIPM under the conditions specified by the 1st CGPM in 1889 when it sanctioned the prototype and declared:

                                This prototype shall henceforth be considered to be the unit of mass.
                                The 3rd CGPM (1901), in a declaration intended to end the ambiguity in popular usage concerning the use of the word "weight", confirmed that:

                                The kilogram is the unit of mass; it is equal to the mass of the international prototype of the kilogram.
                                The complete declaration appears here.

                                It follows that the mass of the international prototype of the kilogram is always 1 kilogram exactly, m(grand K) = 1 kg. However, due to the inevitable accumulation of contaminants on surfaces, the international prototype is subject to reversible surface contamination that approaches 1 µg per year in mass. For this reason, the CIPM declared that, pending further research, the reference mass of the international prototype is that immediately after cleaning and washing by a specified method (PV, 1989, 57, 104-105 and PV, 1990, 58, 95-97). The reference mass thus defined is used to calibrate national standards of platinum-iridium alloy (Metrologia, 1994, 31, 317-336).</description>
